Mentors can give them real world advice on the area, help connect them to housing, community groups and other networks AND (and most importantly in my opinion) can help facilitate a respectful entrance into the Detroit community. It would be wise to have all mentors undergo a training in respectful community entrances and exits (Eastern Michigan Environmental Action Council has provided these in the past) so they can share that information with each person they connect with. This would greatly ease some of the tension between newcomers to the city and long-time residents and, I think, would also play a big part in retention if newcomers are able to understand their place within the greater context of the city and feel welcomed by long-time residents. ","As I stated above, I think the way newcomers enter the Detroit community is crucial. It must be done with respect and in a spirit of collaboration for them to really understand and connect with Detroit and Detroiters and build their own community here. I didn't find this information until I had been here for several years and it was only then that I felt like Detroit was a place I wanted to stay, raise a family and contribute long-term to its community and its success. Will Copeland at the Eastern Michigan Environmental Action Council can provide trainings on entering community respectfully and engaging with community collaboratively.

Being illiterate harms people and the communities they live in.","Community Colleges and the Outdoor Adventure Center on Atwater, Pewabic Pottery",College or univeristy,"People often overlook the option of attending a community college. There are all kinds of classes and programs that are open to everyone of all ages, many for an actual associates degree and leading to a 4 year degree if desired, but there are also many 1-3 day workshops, cultural events, certificate programs, hobby classes, the library, places to walk. Anyone of any age or ability can get started learning something or improving their abilities at a local community college. WCCC also allows residents age 60 and older to attend college free. Macomb Community College allows military veterans to pay the in district tuition rate even if they don't live in Macomb County. Wayne County Community College allows military veterans to pay the in state tuition rate even if they don't live in Michigan (taking classes on line from out of state). Many community colleges all over the state have on line courses with credit that transfers to most 4 year universities. If a person is attending a 4 year school they can still take a class on line from a community college somewhere else in the state at the same time and save some money or take a community college course in the summer to help save money. 
The Outdoor Adventure Center is really cool and lots of people don't know that much about it yet, but it really has a lot of great programs and fun things for people to do. I see it continuing to become more well known and more utilized and treasured as time goes on. 
Pewabic Pottery is really an awesome and kind of secret unless you are way into the arts.

","Set up bus tours for people that already live here. Make it easy for people to get a look at what they have missed, ignored, forgotten about or never saw because its BRAND NEW. Do a campaign that invites local people to live in Detroit like they are on vacation....I do it all the time. I cant get out of town on long trips far away much, so I say to myself, ""What is something I've never done at all or don't do often that someone might do if they were on a visit here to Detroit for business or a vacation.""

Additionally, because of the natural beauty of the neighborhood many home owners that live here take great pride in maintaining these natural spaces and work hard to keep their homes well maintained in spite of challenges of poverty and unemployment in the area which has left the community with many abandoned homes, vacant lots, and high incidents of crime. ","There are a lot of families that live in this neighborhood and I enjoy getting to know my neighbors through first interacting with their children when I'm out walking through the neighborhood. I also enjoy that a lot of people here spend a lot of time outside, so it's easier to get to know my neighbors compared to my time living in an apartment closer to downtown. ","I think the greatest asset of this region is the history. Detroit has a deep and very visible history that you can't ignore if you tried. Unlike other cities where most of the historic buildings have been torn down or hidden behind modern facades,  Detroit for good or bad is filled with historic treasures that have incredible stories behind them, many of which are in the process of being restored and preserved for future generations to enjoy.

","Spend a week here, speak with residents of the city, and explore things in the city that offer unique-to-Detroit experiences. ","Salaries of jobs available in the city need to better reflect housing prices in the city. I have spoken to a number of people who have been ""priced out"" of various parts of the city, or, as in my case, have to commute out of the city in order to secure employment that pays enough to live in the city. This worries me because working in Detroit is the reason I moved here in the first place but as prices have increased it's gotten more challenging to do this. As I get older I want to be able to live in a city where I don't have to worry about getting priced out of my housing in a few years time, or where I have to commute a significant amount to jobs in the suburbs in order to afford to live here.

You can't sell metro Detroit like you can sell Denver because we don't offer those same amenities--and while that doesn't mean we shouldn't highlight the amenities we *do* have, I don't think they're the reason a young, upwardly mobile person would choose to come here. You come or stay in metro Detroit because of the unique opportunity it presents. ","""First ring"" or older suburbs and the potential they represent",Walkable downtown or shopping area,"This goes with the above--but even those who come to metro Detroit for the chance to be a part of a rising region often fail to realize that extends beyond Detroit (or Ferndale, or even Hazel Park) city limits. Downriver communities with more urban-feeling city centers (River Rouge, Wyandotte); places that feel like suburban hell but have a lot going on (Southfield, Southgate)--these places often have tons of history and interesting stories just waiting to be told and built on. Not to mention great restaurants, nice neighborhoods, etc. 

Now that cities are hip again, suburb has become a bad word. And it'd be much easier to tie these places together with regional transit. So for now I count these places as a best kept secret.",Metroparks system is fantastic.,I counted the region as my community so I go back to the potential to get in on the ground floor and make change.,intangible,"Same as above: metro Detroit just isn't Seattle, and no amount of automotive heritage or fancy new hotels will make it so.

",That suburbs are all bad.,Opportunity to be a part of change.,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Metro Detroit is a really exciting place to be because so much is changing, and that means there's more work than ever to do in terms of making sure the change is a net positive for the region as a whole. Don't buy all the hype about Detroit being ""saved""--yes, parts of the region are seeing reinvestment. But you can build a downtown core literally anywhere--metro Detroit has the chance to take advantage of all the best practices that combine economic development with sustainability and opportunity for all.",Neutral,"The national media likes shiny objects so it is what it is. But it's pretty annoying when you live here and you know there are real needs and great ideas that go unaddressed or misunderstood, usually because one of those shiny objects is mischaracterized as somehow taking care of that unmet policy need. (See: economic development as a distraction from equitable tax policy; Detroit Bus Co. as a fix-it for public transit; exciting new hotels as a sub for mixed-income housing in the downtown core; etc.)","In some of my answers I probably sound kind of negative, but I don't mean to be. I totally get why business leaders, those new to the region or those trying to sell the region get all excited about the newest novel thing. But I wish that our business and political leaders had more to say--like literally, I wish they talked loudly about it and also figuratively I wish they took an active role--with regards to policy and creatively reshaping the region.

For example, I'd love to see the business community spearhead something like the Evergreen Collective in Cleveland. Instead, I feel like we get taxpayer-funded arenas and luxury stores for Quicken employees. Not that you can't have both, but it seems like we should be barred from talking about how innovative we are until we're *really* reinventing what it means to be a successful American region in the 21st century.

That could mean: encouraging better civic engagement at the local gov level thru new tech; or taking bold (if calculated) risks instead of stepping away from hard issues like community benefits, sustainability, racial inequality, etc.; or any number of things.

It's hard to be proud of being from a region when a new arena downtown is considered a major win. (Literally any city could get one if they're willing to give a billionaire enough money). That's like expecting folks to be impressed because you added another highway lane. In a lot of ways we're stuck in the last century and there's no marketing campaign that can change that--it's about decisions and leadership.

And while I am more cynical about it, that's not the problem. The problem is that I'm not sure I want to sacrifice the rest of my 30s when this might be my last chance to live as a young person in a 'real' big city region.

Sure, we have some world-class assets, but I can get those anywhere.

I took an internship and had a really positive experience which has now shifted my plans to attempt to relocate to Detroit. I like the culture of the city: it reflects this climate that says welcome, we want you here. A lot of big cities don't do that. And as someone who paid upwards to $1300-1700 for rent I want a city that makes it possible for me to acquire a home. ",That its a unique city with unique problems. It is a city that millennials can come and afford a place to live while leading real change.,I think you start early - create communications outreach plan that helps new students feel welcome to their institution. It also should emphasize they should consider an internship in Detroit - that was how I got connected and stayed connected. Connecting with organizations like After 5 Detroit would be really beneficial - my internship organization partnered with them and it helped me to see the cultural and social aspects of Detroit.,"The polarization: it's the wild west of everything that could go wrong in a government/community OR that the comeback of the city is nearly complete. You hear very conflicting things and I don't think either is quite true. If I were leading a brand regarding Detroit, I would want to emphasize the breadth of Detroit - its such a large city and it is comprised of really unique neighborhoods. As a college student, I would want to learn more about what makes neighborhoods within Detroit unique and if I move there, how can I help to contribute to the success of that particular neighborhood? (e.g., the revitalization of the Woodbridge area is a really good example).Brand messaging needs to be rooted in truth, based in reality, relatable to your core audience, and achievable in product performance. Also I think Detroit's brand is multi-dimensional and also changing - what is relevant or organic now could not be in 5-10 years. The brand has to be something that can evolve along with the city. If it isn't organic or truthful - millennials won't be convinced.","""Grit & Grace."" Those words come to mind when I think of Detroit. It is a city that has some of the most hardworking, innovative talented people. Those who aren't impressed by flash but are compelled to build/develop something dependable and altruistic. From the former Ford plant worker to the tech company, there is room for everyone in Detroit. That is an important distinction from cities like San Francisco and Washington DC. Their high housing market, gentrification, preference to tech and govt industries is known among millennials and many hesitate to move there because of it. Detroit has room for everyone. That matters. I would say the ""grace"" component is reflective of the ""refinement"" movement regarding city development and the desire to refurbish where it is possible. That distinction gives Detroit a charm in recognizing that there is beauty in everything, everywhere. Instead of demolishing, the city takes the time to find the beauty in restoration - from urban planning to our physical environment.The hustle is palpable..infectious really.
